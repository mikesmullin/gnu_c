    //   i wonder how that works when javascript is doing something
    //   does it get interrupted by setTimeout? or does setTimeout get delayed?
    //   i would guess it has to get delayed
    //   i could test this in node
    //     setTimeout(function(){console.log('interrupt');}, 1000); while(1){}; # uninterruptable?
    //   aha so if there is a system-level blocking event happening, setTimeout gets delayed
    //   which makes sense cuz how else could the main event loop operate?
