callback()

# will i have labels?
# i will keep the * dereference and & addressOf and &&label syntax
# i see some overlap/reusability between * for dereference as well as a ruby-like array splat
# i want to provide iterators/enumerators as powerful as Ruby Time.now(), and Hash.map() and .reduce() and .each() or foreach or for in/of
# i want to provide ranges [0..9] and [0...10] as well
# i want to provide all the fun logical operators from gorillascript and coffeescript like: is, and, or, isnt
# i want to provide: if, unless
# does C have try and catch? NO, it doesn't. you must catch your own
#   errors similar to nodejs callback err convention
#   well not really, it expects you to return a failure code from each function
#   but we'll be damned if we try that
# let's finish up with parenthesis and try some fun with lamdas
# i am liking ansi c more and more now that i read about it :)
# the magical bullshit other languages add on top of it is waste
# i definitely want string interpolation
# i should make lowercase null, false, true  translate to uppercase equivalent literals NULL, 0, 1

# lets find the setTimeout equivalent
# include and import and require should be interchangable until i find a better reason to differentiate
#   well, include is limited to header files
#   so import and require should include other .c files so they dont have to specified to the compiler at compile time
#   maybe GNU C makes this possible somehow already?

# i should use a "use strict;" mode
  # one that also adds #pragma to output to ASM
  # and one that requires user to specify unsigned char instead of just char
  # and possibly ass -pedantic to the gcc compiler so it warns about that type of crap
